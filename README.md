# Superstore Profitability & Discount Analysis (Tableau)

## Project Overview
This project is a 1st Edition analysis for profitability drivers in a retail business using the Superstore dataset.
The objective is to understand how **discount strategies, product mix, and regional performance**
impact overall profit, profit margins, and loss-making orders.

The analysis is presented through two Tableau dashboards designed for executive decision-making
and operational insight.

## 📊 Dashboard 1: Understanding Profitability Drivers

### Key Metrics
- **Total Revenue:** $2.30M  
- **Net Profit:** $286K  
- **Profit Margin:** 12.5%  
- **Loss-Making Orders:** 37.35%

### Insights
- Despite strong overall revenue, more than **one-third of orders generate negative profit**.
- Profitability is unevenly distributed across products and regions.

### Visual Analysis
- **Profit Evolution Over Time:**  
  Profit shows an overall upward trend, but with noticeable fluctuations, indicating periods of
  weaker margin performance rather than consistent growth.

- **Profit by Category:**  
  - *Technology* is the primary profit driver.  
  - *Office Supplies* contribute moderately.  
  - *Furniture* generates significantly lower profit, highlighting potential pricing or cost issues.

- **Profit by Region:**  
  - The *West* and *East* regions outperform others.  
  - The *Central* region underperforms, suggesting regional inefficiencies or unfavorable market conditions.

### Key Takeaway
> Revenue growth does not always translate into profitability. Product mix and regional performance
play a critical role in determining profit outcomes.

## 📉 Dashboard 2: Impact of Discounting on Profitability

### Visual Analysis
- **Discount vs Profit (Scatter Plot):**  
  Higher average discount levels are frequently associated with lower or negative profit.
  Some sub-categories maintain profitability at moderate discounts, but aggressive discounting
clearly erodes margins.

- **Profit Margin by Discount Level:**  
  - Orders with **no discount** show the highest profit margins.  
  - Margins decline steadily as discounts increase.  
  - Discounts above **20% lead to strongly negative margins**, indicating unsustainable pricing.

- **Top Loss-Making Sub-Categories:**  
  A small number of sub-categories (e.g., Tables, Bookcases, Supplies) account for a disproportionate
share of total losses.

### Key Takeaway
> Higher discount levels are strongly associated with declining profit margins and an increased
concentration of losses in specific product categories.

## 🧠 Business Conclusions
- Discounts drive volume but can significantly undermine profitability if not carefully controlled.
- Losses are concentrated in specific products rather than spread evenly across the portfolio.
- Targeted pricing and discount optimization can improve margins without sacrificing overall sales.
